# Capstone Turing MLxDL
## Notebooks
### 0 - Fundamental
[] notebook runs without errors (data is available)

[] clearly structured using headers: Data, Models, Results

[] includes both code and textual explanations

[] clear references to blogs/kaggle and all other sources (URL is sufficient)

[] sufficient 'work', show you did not just copy&paste but also understand what is happening

### 1 - Data
* Data Collection

[] Explain where your data comes from. If you have collected the data yourself, include the code otherwise include the source.

* Exploratory Data Analysis

[] Find some interesting things about your dataset and discuss them. Use descriptive statistics, plots, etc.

* Unsupervised Machine Learning

[] Apply an Unsupervised algorithm to find clusters or reduce dimensionality.

[] Explain the algorithm you used (intuitively) and interpret the results.

### 2 - Models
* Supervised Machine Learning

[] Describe the label and any feature preprocessing.

[]] Apply a Supervised algorithm to predict this label.

[] Explain the algorithm you used (intuitively) and interpret the results.

* Deep / Ensemble Learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost)

[] Apply a Deep or Ensemble Learning algorithm to predict the (same) label.

[] Explain the algorithm you used (intuitively) and interpret the results.

[] Compare the results with a benchmark model (you could use the second model here).

* Hyperparameter Tuning

[] Describe the hyperparameters used in both models.

[] Tune the hyperparameters and explain how you selected them.

### 3 - Results
* Selection

[] Describe the metrics used.

* Interpretation

[] Compare the different models and intuitively describe the differences.

* Validation

[] Explain how you split the date into test/train samples.

* Discussion

[] Discuss any issues you ran into or further ideas for improving the results.
