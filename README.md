## Welcome to the Turing MLxDL course
### Learn, _by doing_

`HelloWorld!` We are Data Science enthusiasts, MOOC junkies, code geeks.... We have collected our favorite educational resources and formed them into this course. 

In seven weeks, we will cover end-to-end Data Science. This means that we will touch upon various methods and applications. Throughout the course you will be working on a (team) project. By working on a topic that interests you (medicine, finance, marketing, food..), it will be easier to stick with the (complicated) theory and understand *why* it is important to learn certain things.

### Team

We are a group of five:
- [Eva](https://evavanrooijen.github.io/)
- Vikram
- Pedro
- Kyara
- Eunji

### Prerequisites
- Machine Learning Theory: studied some of the common models either in an online courses or academic studies
- Python: experience with pandas and optionally: scikit-learn, numpy, pytorch, keras

### Curriculum

#### Week 1: Data Collection and Exploratory Analysis $ X $[more info](Data.md)
Data is everywhere! Did you know that only 5 percent of the information is only privately available?
Tools like web scraping help you collect data. Databases are the storage units for your data.
To-Do : add cloud computing information

#### Week 2: Unsupervised Machine Learning [more info](USL.md)
Exploratory Data Analysis
Clustering, DImREd to help aid information overload

#### Week 3: Supervised Machine Learning  $ f(x, y) $ [more info](SL.md)
Labels

#### Week 4: Deep Learning (Theory)  $ f(f(x, y)) $[more info](NN.md)

#### Week 5: Computer Vision[more info](CV.md)

#### Week 6: Natural Language Processing[more info](NLP.md)

#### Week 7: Reinforcement Learning[more info](RL.md)
