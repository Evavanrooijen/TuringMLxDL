## Welcome to the Turing MLxDL course
### Learn, _by doing_

`HelloWorld!` We are Data Science enthusiasts, MOOC junkies, code geeks.... We have collected our favorite educational resources and formed them into this course. 

In seven weeks, we will cover end-to-end Data Science. This means that we will touch upon various methods and applications. Throughout the course you will be working on a (team) project. By working on a topic that interests you (medicine, finance, marketing, food..), it will be easier to stick with the (complicated) theory and understand *why* it is important to learn certain things.
